# User Registration Application

## Description
The User Registration Application is a simple user authentication system built using Python and CustomTkinter. It allows users to sign in, log in, and navigate through a basic graphical interface. This project serves as a great starting point for learning Python GUI development and handling user credentials.

## Features
- **Sign-In Functionality**: Users can create an account with an email and password.
- **Login Validation**: Users can log in with their credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate feedback for incorrect login attempts.
- **Dynamic UI**: Interface updates dynamically based on user actions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) (install via pip: `pip install customtkinter`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python userregs.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- **Main Frame**: Contains dynamic UI components.
- **Sign In Function**: Handles user sign-up.
- **Login Function**: Validates user credentials and provides feedback.
- **Home Page Function**: Displays the primary interface.

## Next Steps
